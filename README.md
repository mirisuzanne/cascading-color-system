# Cascading Color Systems

[Demo Site](https://cascading-colors.netlify.com/)

Generate dynamic and themable color palettes using CSS custom properties,
and allow (persistent) user-adjustments with a bit of light-weight JS.

We provide both the Sass,
and a pre-built CSS file.
Both allow adjustments to default settings --
but only the Sass files can change how many colors are generated.

## Requirements

This was partially an experiment
in Sass Modules,
currently in beta.
We use the module syntax throughout,
so currently this requires the beta release of Dart-Sass.

## Docs

Coming soonâ€¦
