/// # Import CSS or Sass
///
/// @group import

/// ## CSS
/// If you are happy with the default settings,
/// you can import the generated CSS directly.
/// The default import includes 4 themes,
/// with 4 tints and 4 shades for each color:
///
/// ```
/// <path-to-package>/css/ccs.css
/// ```
///
/// @group import
@use 'ccs' with ($build: true);

/// ## Sass
/// If you are using Sass
/// (Dart-Sass v1.23+ required)
/// Import the `_index.scss` file with your custom configuration.
/// Sass imports index files by default,
/// so you can drop the file name from your import if you like:
///
/// ```scss
///  @use '<path-to-package>/';
/// ```
///
/// You can also configure the namespace and default settngs:
///
/// ```scss
///  @use '<path-to-package>/' as 'colors' with (
///    $build: true,
///    $steps: 6,
///  );
/// ```
///
/// @group import
