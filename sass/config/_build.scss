/// # Global Sass Settings
/// These settings can be defined [directly in CSS](config-css.html),
/// or generated from Sass configuration --
/// and they provide the baseline defaults for all
/// dynamic calculations.
/// Each Sass variable has a corresponding custom property
/// that can be used instead.
///
/// By default, all Sass configurations are set to `null`
/// so that they have no output --
/// and "factory-default" fallback values are provided
/// in CSS calls to `var(--name, <fallback>)`.
/// That ensures that you can set defaults anywhere,
/// without running into specificity conflicts.
